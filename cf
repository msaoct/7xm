Computer forensics:
Computer forensics is a scientific process of obtaining, preserving, and documenting the
evidence from various electronic and digital storage devices namely, computers, mobile
phones, digital cameras and memory storage devices. Digital evidence is collected and
preserved by computer forensics investigators. The evidence collection should be done in a
systematic manner following set rules and procedures in such a way that the collected digital
evidence is authentic and not modified, only then the evidence will be admissible in the court
of law or any legal proceedings.
In today’s tech savvy world, many people across the globe prefer using gadgets like computers,
laptops, smart phones, iPads, etc. for communication and online transactions. Organisations
use various security measures to protect confidential data. In spite of the security measures
taken, cyber-crime still occurs and is growing day by day.
Hence, we use Computer Forensics to investigate digital crimes such as hacking of information
online via bank accounts, credit cards, emails, social networking websites, etc.
Computer forensics is a technological practice to identify, collect, analyse and report various
forms of digital evidences in such a way that they are legally admissible in the court of law.
It issued to detect and prevent various technology based crimes, as well as to identify where
evidence is stored in various digital media devices. The term ‘Computer Forensics’ is a
synonym of ‘Digital Forensics’ and the two can be used interchangeably.


Data security breach:
Data security is required to all the information
stored in different types of electronic devices. In spite of securing data, we come across
incidents where in the data has either been stolen or accessed by unauthorised personnel (called
as data security breach).


The evolution of Computer forensics:
1. Ad-hoc phase: In the beginning, there was a lack of structure, appropriate tools, written
processes and procedures. No clear goals were defined and there was a lack of legal
framework.
2. Structured phase: During this phase, various first generation tools and techniques were
developed and employed. But most of them were quite complex. The most important thing
in this phase was the development and enabling of the criminal legislation.
3. Enterprise phase: In this stage is when tools were better developed. Techniques and written
procedures made available allowed various OS, databases and applications to be analysed
using only one tool. This allowed real-time remote and field data collection and analysis.


Cyber Crime:
Cybercrime refers to criminal activities that involve computers, networks, and digital information. 
These illegal activities are carried out by individuals, groups, or organizations with the intent to 
exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, and online platforms for financial gain, disruption, 
or other malicious purposes. Cybercrime is a broad term 
that encompasses various types of criminal activities conducted in the digital realm. 
Some common forms of cybercrime include:
1. Phishing: Cybercriminals use deceptive emails, messages, or websites to trick individuals into providing sensitive information, such as passwords or financial details.
2. Malware: Malicious software, including viruses, worms, Trojans, and ransomware, is designed to infect and damage computer systems, steal information, or demand ransom payments.
3. Identity Theft: Criminals may use stolen personal information to impersonate individuals, commit fraud, or gain unauthorized access to financial accounts.
4. Hacking: Unauthorized access to computer systems or networks to exploit vulnerabilities, steal information, or disrupt operations.
5. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks: Overloading a target's website or online service with traffic to make it unavailable to users.
6. Cyber Espionage: State-sponsored or criminal groups may engage in cyber-espionage to gather sensitive information from governments, businesses, or individuals.
7. Online Fraud: Various forms of fraudulent schemes conducted over the internet, such as online scams, pyramid schemes, or auction fraud.
8. Cyberbullying: Harassment, threats, or intimidation carried out online, often through social media platforms.
9. Data Breaches: Unauthorized access to and disclosure of sensitive data, often resulting in the exposure of personal or financial information.
10. Money Laundering: Criminals may use digital currencies or online financial systems to legitimize illegally obtained funds.
Cyber-crime happens in various forms including:
-Intellectual Property Theft: Unauthorized acquisition or use of intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights, or trade secrets.

Myths about Computer Forensics:
Myth #1: Conducting a live forensics investigation inevitably alters the system, making it invalid for court. 
Reality: While live forensics alters the system, the court still considers it valid.
Myth #2: Digital forensics actions must not change data for it to be admissible in court. 
Reality: Courts do not explicitly state this; if sound methodology is used and changes are documented, evidence remains admissible.
Myth #3: Evidence images must produce identical hash values for court acceptance. 
Reality: Courts do not require identical hash values; they assist but are not mandatory.


Need for Cyber forensics:
1. Surging Cybercrime: Increasing digital offenses demand cyber forensics for investigation and prevention.
2. Digital Evidence Retrieval: Essential for extracting evidence from devices related to crimes like hacking and data breaches.
3. Terrorism Tracking: Crucial in identifying and investigating terrorists using the internet for recruitment and communication.
4. Security Auditing: Key for auditing, fraud detection, and ensuring compliance through analysis of audit logs and activities.

Rules of Computer Forensics:
In computer forensics domain, there are various rules employed during and after the forensic
examination process. Some of most common rules are categorised as follows:
1) Rules for Admissibility of Evidences:
Rule 1: Evidences must be relevant; for instance, a bank transaction log is admissible in a fraud case, but a loan recovery log is not.
Rule 2: Evidences must be identifiable and self-authenticating, relying on sources like public records. Forensic experts verify digital records' authenticity to prevent tampering.
2) Rules for Chain of Custody:
A chain of custody is a way to guarantee the identity and integrity of evidence from collection
through to the testimony of the analysis reports in a court of law. It officially starts with the
identification and documentation of the relevant evidence by law enforcement agencies. The
chain of custody document contains the following information:
-Who seized the evidence: Their name, designation, e-mail, phone number, etc.
-When the evidence was seized: Actual time and date, the system CMOS date and time
-Physical description of the evidence item: serial no., tag, make and model, etc.
3) Rules for Evidence Integrity:
To ensure that the evidence in question is not altered, various methods are employed. Some of
these are:
-Bit-by-bit copy
-Evidence is locked in safe and limited access cabinets called safes, or vaults
-The use of cryptographic hashes like md5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5), sha1(Secure
Hash Algorithm-1), sha2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2), etc., to ensure the integrity of the
original evidence media
-The use of write blocker to protect the evidence from modification
-To create and maintain chain of custody documents


Cyber Forensics Investigation and evidence:
Computer forensics investigation is an organised process just like any other traditional law-
enforcement investigation. Specially trained forensics investigators follow specific computer
forensics methodology that has standard operating procedures to collect potential evidence
from the scene of crime in an efficient way. This should be done by following a forensically
sound process with minimal invasion so that the gathered artefacts can be used as evident in a
court of law.
By definition: “Any information with a probative value is evidence”-CA: USborn, 2003.
Evidence may be stored in:
• CDs/DVDs
• Hard Disk Media
• USB devices
• Memory cards
• Text messages
• Phone records
• E-mails
• Digital images
• Various application records
• Web-sites
• Browser history


There are different types of forgery. They include:
• Forged signatures of real and created personas
• Fraudulent documents with a real signature
• Traced signatures
• Digital scanning and inserting of signatures
• Forced signatures by coercing victims
• Disguised forgery


9 Phases of Digital Forensics:
1.First Response:Immediate reaction to a security incident, involving the initial steps taken by the forensics team to address and contain the situation.
2.Search and Seizure:Conducting a comprehensive search of all affected devices and seizing them to prevent further malicious activities.
3.Evidence Collection:Gathering relevant electronic evidence from seized devices, ensuring a thorough and systematic approach.
4.Securing the Evidence:Implementing measures to safeguard collected evidence, preventing any unauthorized access or alterations.
5.Data Acquisition:Carefully retrieving electronically stored information (ESI) following standard procedures to minimize the risk of unintentional data alteration.
6.Data Analysis:Scrutinizing the gathered ESI to identify and extract data pertinent to the investigation and potential legal proceedings.
7.Evidence Assessment:Evaluating and determining the relevance of identified data as evidence in relation to the case under investigation.
8.Documentation and Reporting:Systematically documenting all findings and related data in compliance with legal standards, creating a comprehensive report of the investigation.
9.Expert Witness Testimony:Involves presenting an expert witness who can confirm the relevance and reliability of the gathered data as admissible evidence in a court of law.


Some of the major email related crimes are described below:
• E-mail spoofing: E-mail spoofing is when an e-mail looks like any other, except is has
a spoofed source. Sometimes, it is difficult to identify the sender of the e-mail and their
motive. Cyber-criminals simply forge the source mail ID and the location just to hide
their identity.
• Spreading Trojans, viruses and worms: E-mail has become the easiest medium to
spread malware programs over the Internet. The ‘Love Bug’ virus is the most common
example that reached millions of users within 36 hours of its release from the
Philippines.
• E-mail bombing: E-mail bombing refers to sending numerous e-mails to the target,
resulting in getting access to, or crashing, the target. The simplest form of e-mail
bombing is to subscribe the target with various mailing lists which send thousands of
e-mails on a daily basis.
• Threatening e-mails: The growing use of internet and social media make it easy for
hackers to get anyone’s e-mail IDs over the internet. Cyber-criminals target users
through e-mail anonymously and start sending threatening e-mails.
• Defamatory emails: Yet another form of e-mail crime is defamatory e-mails. Cyber-
defamation has become quite common and could prove to be destructive for, or
harmful to, or victimise the target.
• E-mail Frauds: As discussed earlier, e-mail spoofing is easy and is very often used to
commit various financial crimes. E-mail anonymity has made it easy for the offenders
to commit such crimes, especially financial gain. You might have heard about various
Nigerian scams related to this.


Critical infrastructure for any nation could be the following:
• Power plants
• Nuclear plants
• Transportation
• Satellite

White Hat Hackers: Ethical hackers who improve security, often working for national interests, by uncovering vulnerabilities.
Gray Hat Hackers: Violate security without permission but inform the organization, potentially publicizing vulnerabilities.


Hacking Attacks:
DoS/DDoS Attacks: Attempts to make a service or host machine unavailable to users.
Sniffing: Ethical hacking method to intercept and analyze network traffic for abnormalities.
Spoofing: Concealing the sender's identity by using a forged source IP address.
Malware/Back Door/Trojans/RAT: Various malicious software, including viruses, worms, and spyware.
Key Loggers: Record keystrokes, capturing passwords and sensitive information.
Phishing & Social Engineering: Deceptive tactics to obtain information, often through fake emails or impersonation.
Website Hacking: Common methods include SQL injection, Denial of Service (DOS) attacks, cookie poisoning, and DNS spoofing.
Phone Phreaking: Unauthorized access to the phone system, allowing for making calls without proper authorization.
Cookie Poisoning: Unauthorized modification of a user's cookie for identity theft or unauthorized access.
DNS Poisoning (Spoofing): Manipulating DNS to redirect users, risking security breaches or unauthorized access.


There are three basic steps involved in the money laundering process. These are:
1. Placement: This is the act of introducing illegitimately acquired money into the financial
system.
2. Layering: This is the act of hiding the actual source of that money by creating a series of
transactions in order to make it look legitimate.
3. Integration: This is the final stage where the ‘laundered’ money is re-introduced into the
economy.


Computer Forensics Tools:
Computer forensics tools can be
categorised into the following types:
-Acquisition: Some of the well-known tools in this category are: FTK, MoonSol, DD, EnCase, BelkaSoft
-Validation and Discrimination: While creating a copy of the evidence, we create hashes of evidences to verify the integrity of
the evidences. Various free and open source tools could be employed for this process, such as
FTK, EnCase, BelkaSoft, SleuthKit and Hash Keeper. Hash Keeper is a well-known tool in this category and is widely used by industry professionals.
-Extraction and Analysis: Tools in this category are FTK, EnCase, ProDiscover, BelkaSoft and Volatility. SleuthKit is the oldest and the most widely used open source tools, by industry professionals,
for data recovery and analysis.
-Reporting: Once the analysis is complete, the report has to be created, for client presentation, with proper
evidence, in a chronological manner, to identify the sequence of events that leads to the
incidents. Most of the commercial tools have an in-built reporting feature that allows us to
select the components of the report while performing the analysis itself. Some examples of these
tools are FTK, EnCase, BelkaSoft, ProDiscover and SleuthKit.

Presentation:
Effectively communicating the findings to stakeholders, often including technical and non-technical audiences, providing insights into the incident.
Review:
Conducting a thorough review of the entire investigation process, ensuring that all steps were followed correctly and that the conclusions are well-supported.


Use of BitLocker During Forensics Investigation:
BitLocker is a full-disk encryption feature in Windows that can be employed during forensics investigations. Its use involves:
Encryption and Decryption:
BitLocker encrypts the entire disk, rendering the data unreadable without the appropriate decryption key.
Key Management:
Investigating authorities need to manage and secure BitLocker recovery keys to access encrypted data. Recovery keys may be stored in Active Directory or backed up separately.
Data Recovery:
If a suspect's device is encrypted with BitLocker, investigators may need to obtain the recovery key to access the data for analysis.
Forensic Tools:
Specialized forensic tools may be employed to work with BitLocker-encrypted drives, allowing investigators to analyze the encrypted data without altering its integrity.

Documentation:
Thoroughly documenting the condition of the evidence, the methods used for preservation, and any changes made during the investigation.
Secure Storage:
Storing physical evidence securely in controlled environments to prevent tampering or unauthorized access.
Legal Admissibility:
Ensuring that evidence preservation practices align with legal requirements and standards to maintain its admissibility in court.


Evidence Preservation
• Document every action taken and record every possible change observed during the
response.
• Verify whether the monitor is on/off/in sleep mode, or if a screen saver is running.
• Photograph the back of the computer to keep a record of how the cables are connected.
• Remove the power cable, if the device is off and label it. Do not turn the device on.
• Check dial-up, cable, ISDN and DSL connections, if any.
• Remove the power cord from the router or modem if required.
• Remove any USB/CD/DVD, if available, to protect the potential evidence.
• Label all the evidence collected, accordingly.


First responder:
A successful forensics investigation depends upon the response provided by officers during the
first interaction with the system. This is called the First Response and people who provide the
first response are called the First Responders.
When an incident has been identified and reported, the first responder (a person who is the
first to arrive at the incident place) starts the basic investigation. The first responder could be a
local system/network administrator, a Law Enforcement Agency employee, or a forensics
investigator and is responsible for identifying and preserving the evidence obtained from the
incident scene.
The crime scene processing tools that an investigator should have are as follows:
• Cameras
• Notepads
• Various evidence forms
• Crime scene tape
• Markers
• Pair of gloves

The main responsibilities of a first responder are as follows:
• Identify and verify of the crime scene
• Protect the crime scene
• Collect all the information relevant to the incident
• Preserve temporary and fragile evidence
• Document all actions and findings
• Package and transport the electronic evidence


First responder Tool kit:
The first responder needs to create a toolkit prior to any potential evidence collection. When a
crime is reported, a person should report to the site immediately and not waste time in
gathering evidence materials.
Steps to create a First Responder Toolkit:
Step 1 - A trusted forensic computer or test bed to be created.
Step 2 - Document the forensic computer detail.
Step 3 - Document the summary of collected tools.
Step 4 – Test the tools.


The three different groups of people involved in first response to an incident are as follows:
- Forensics staff/expert:
A person who harvests and analyses the evidence from computers, laptops, networks, or any
other form of data storage device, is known as a forensics expert.
The responsibilities of a Forensic Expert are as follows:
• Securing the crime scene.
• Documenting the crime scene.
• Conducting security incident investigations and data breach investigations.
• Recovering and examining data from all electronic storage devices.
• Conducting interviews with people concerning the crime scene and documenting the
results.
• Collecting and preserving evidence.
• Labelling and securing the evidence with bags and tags.
• Transporting of evidence if required.
- Local managers or senior technical staff/non forensics staff
The system/network administrator plays an important role in ensuring local system/network
protection and daily maintenance. They also play a key role in the incident investigation
process. Once an incident has been identified, it has to be reported as per the internal incident
reporting process. This directly goes to the local system/network admin, based on the category
and the severity of the incident reported. Depending on the type and severity, they can access 
the system in question. If it has been marked as critical and for forensics investigation, they
should not access the system unless directed by the concerned team.
- System/Network Administrators, or non-technical staff: Senior technical or managerial staff has to 
preserve the crime scene till the forensics team arrive on the site.They should always document the crime scene 
and once the forensics team arrives,it has to be handed over.

Data Acquisition:
The first step in the forensic process is to identify and acquire possible digital evidence from
various sources. This is known as data/evidence acquisition. The inherent issue with digital
devices is that they easily are modified due to various read/write operations. Data acquisition
must be performed using the bit-by-bit copy method to ensure that every part of the drive is
copied to the new device. For example, Data acquired from a storage device such as an USB device is stored in a data file.
The acquisition tool performs bit by bit copy of the USB drive and writes it to an image file
which will the exact replica/duplicate of the source device.


Storage Formats for Digital Evidence:
The three most popular methods are:
1. Raw Format: It can be created with most available freeware and commercial grade tools including encase,
FTK. Rediscover, DD etc.
Advantages:
• Data transfer is faster
• Minor data read errors on the source drive can be ignored
• Most of the computer forensics tools can read the raw format
Disadvantages:
• Bigger in size
• Tools may miss bad sector data
2. Proprietary Format:
A proprietary format is a file format of a company, organisation, or individual that contains
data that is ordered and stored according to a particular encoding-scheme, designed by the
company or organisation to be secret, such that the decoding and interpretation of this stored
data is easily accomplished with particular software or hardware that the company itself has
developed.
Key features include:
-Compression Options:
Purpose: Choose to compress or not compress image files.
Advantage: Saves space on the target drive.
-Segmentation Capabilities:
Purpose: Split images into smaller segments for archiving.
Advantage: Integrates data integrity checks for secure storage.
-Metadata Integration:
Purpose: Add metadata like acquisition date, hash value, investigator details.
Advantage: Enhances documentation and evidence authentication.
Advantages:
• Various options are available to compress the data in order to reduce space used.
• Image splitting facility in multiple parts.
• Can integrate metadata into the image file.
Disadvantages
• Image sharing and opening between different tools is not possible.
3. Advanced Forensic Format: AFF is a simple, compact, self-describing and open way to capture and move around disk
images. AFF is superior to existing disk imaging formats.
Advantages
• No size restriction.
• Provides space for metadata.
• Open source for multiple platforms and OS support.
• Internal consistency checks for self-authentication.
Types of acquisitions
• Static/Dead acquisitions
• Live acquisitions
Commonly used methods
1. Bit-stream disk-to-image file:
Bit-stream disk-to-image file: This is the most commonly used method in the industry
that allows the creation more than one copy and is done through the bit-for-bit copy of
each sector on the original drive.
Commonly used tools:
• ProDiscover- Encase
• FTK Imager- SMART
• Sleuth Kit- X-Ways
2. Bit-stream disk-to-disk:
This method is used mostly for dead drives. One must consider
the disc geometry configuration before starting the acquisition.
Commonly used tools:
• Encase
• Safe Back
3. Logical imaging:
This method is commonly used when there is a limited time to
perform the operation, or there is a limitation on the whole disc or drive access. It simply
copies specific files or folders in the acquisition. It is especially used for the acquisition of
user files, like Outlook and browser activity.
Acquisition checklist
• Use a write protector.
• Start a chain of custody, immediately.

data set or images. Various cryptographic checksums are being utilised in the industry, but the
three most popular ones are:
• md5
• sha1
• sha2
The tools for checksum verification are:
• md5sum
• Hashdeep


Data Deletion:
When a file is deleted, only the entry in the file system metadata is removed, while the actual
data is still on the disk. After a format and even a repartitioning it might be that most of raw
data is untouched and can be recovered using file carving.

The main causes of data deletion is listed below:
1. Intentional action
• Intentional deletion of a file or program.
2. Unintentional action
• Accidental deletion of a file or folder.
• Mishandling optical media, the memory, or flash drives.
• Unknown file format.
3. Disc failure
• Power failure causes volatile memory data loss.
• Hardware failure, like head or the spindle motor.
• File system failure due to corruption.
4. Natural disaster
• Earthquakes, floods, etc.
• Fire
5. Criminal action
• Data theft, online hacking, SQL injection, etc.
• Use of malware software.


When a file is deleted from a Windows system:
-When a file is deleted from a Windows system, the following typically occurs:
-Moved to Recycle Bin: Initially, the file is not permanently removed but is moved to the Recycle Bin, providing a chance for recovery.
-File Allocation Table (FAT) Update: The file's entry in the File Allocation Table, which keeps track of file locations on the disk, is marked as "deleted." The space is now marked as available for new data.
-Deletion from Recycle Bin: If the user chooses to empty the Recycle Bin or if the Recycle Bin reaches its storage limit, the file is then permanently deleted from the file system.
-Data Lingers on Disk: Even after deletion, the actual data may linger on the disk until new data overwrites it. Specialized recovery tools can sometimes retrieve deleted files before this overwrite occurs.
-File System Metadata Updates: Metadata updates, indicating the file's deletion, occur in the Master File Table (MFT) for NTFS file systems or File Allocation Table (FAT) for FAT file systems.
-Recovery Challenges: As time passes and more data is written to the disk, the chances of successful file recovery diminish, as the space previously occupied by the deleted file gets gradually overwritten


Steps for data recovery:
Step 1: Repair the physical hard disk faults.
Step 2: Disc imaging to a reliable media to start recovery process.
Step 3: Logical recovery of partition table, master boot records (MBR), MFT and files.
Step 4: Repair partial files and damaged files.


Bad Sectors:
Bad sectors are permanent damage on hard disk partitions, rendering data written to them inaccessible and often causing hard disk crashes.
Common Causes:
-Manufacturing defects result in default bad sectors.
-Physical errors and heat contribute to the development of bad sectors.
-Over time, HDD platters lose magnetic properties, leading to the occurrence of bad sectors.
-Power Surges: Sudden power surges or outages can result in bad sectors, particularly during the writing process.
-Aging Components: Wear and tear on hard drive components over extended use can lead to the emergence of bad sectors.
Impact on Data:
-Bad sectors may cause data loss and render a drive unusable.
-Data recovery becomes necessary in cases of drive corruption.
Data Recovery Techniques due to data loss caused by bad sectors:
Step 1 - Drive Attachment:
Attach the corrupted hard disk as a secondary drive to another computer.
Step 2 - Recovery Process:
Copy files from the corrupted drive to a new one (if readable).
Utilize specialized data recovery software for comprehensive recovery.
Employ forensic disk acquisition tools like FTK for disc copying and specialized data recovery programs.
Advanced Recovery Techniques due to data loss caused by bad sectors:
-Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM):
Images and measures surfaces at the atomic level.
Scans a sharp probe over a surface, producing a 3D topographic image at the atomic scale.
-Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM):
Derives from scanning probe microscopy.
Uses a magnetic tip on a flexible cantilever to analyze spatial variation in magnetic forces.
Images reveal data loss, with old data persisting instead of new data.
-Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM):
Conducted in high vacuum for surface analysis.
Measures electrical current between tip and sample.
Generates images, similar to MFM, showcasing data discrepancies.

RAID Data Acquisitions:
Working with RAID devices presents significant challenges in the forensics domain, especially given their prevalence in enterprise server architectures. RAID, standing for Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks, or Redundant Array of Independent Disks, is a virtual storage technique aiming at data redundancy and performance improvement.
RAID Types:
-RAID 0 (Striping):
Characteristics: No redundancy, total capacity is the sum of individual disks.
Operation: Data striping for concurrent read/write operations.
Risk: Failure of one disk leads to the failure of the entire volume.
-RAID 1 (Mirroring):
Characteristics: Data mirroring for improved performance.
Operation: Same data written on two or more drives.
Advantage: Redundancy as data can be read from any disk.
-RAID 2 (Bit-Level Striping):
Characteristics: Bit-level striping with multiple error-checking disks.
Usage: Not commonly used in commercial applications.
-RAID 3 (Bit-Level Striping with Parity):
Characteristics: Bit-level striping with one drive dedicated to parity.
Suitability: Suited for larger file storage with sequential data read/write.
-RAID 4 (Block-Level Striping with Dedicated Parity):
Characteristics: Block-level striping with dedicated parity.
Advantage: Provides read/write parallelism over RAID 2 and 3.
-RAID 5 (Block-Level Striping with Distributed Parity):
Characteristics: Data striped in blocks, distributed parity for better data viability.
Usage: Most commonly used RAID type, requires a minimum of three disks.
-RAID 6 (Double Distributed Parity):
Characteristics: Block-level striping with double distributed parity.
Considerations: Offers drive fault tolerance but comes with higher cost.


RAID Acquisition Methods:
RAID poses challenges for forensics analysts, especially given its large size. Considerations before RAID acquisition include:
-Storage Needs: Assess the required storage capacity for the RAID acquisition.

Chain of Custody:
A chain of custody is the process of documenting all changes in the control, handling,
possession, ownership, or custody of a piece of evidence, till the time it reaches the court of
law. You should be able to trace the path that evidence takes from the time it is collected till
the time you present it in court of law or at a corporate meeting.
Maintaining Chain of Custody:
-The digital signature for each piece of digital evidence.
-The exact location of where each digital evidence is handled.
-The exact date-time of where it was accessed.
-The exact identify of all the people who accessed the evidence.
-The complete description of all transactions that have occurred.


Importance of Chain of Custody:
-Preservation of Integrity: Chain of custody ensures the preservation of evidence integrity throughout its lifecycle, maintaining its original state and reliability.
-Legal Admissibility: It enhances the legal admissibility of evidence by demonstrating a secure and documented path from collection to presentation in court.
-Credibility Assurance: Establishing a clear chain of custody enhances the credibility of evidence, reinforcing its trustworthiness in legal proceedings.
-Protects Against Tampering: It safeguards against tampering or unauthorized access, providing a transparent record of everyone who handled the evidence.
-Facilitates Investigation: A well-maintained chain of custody streamlines investigations, enabling a systematic and accountable process for handling crucial pieces of evidence.


Best practices to be followed for maintaining the digital evidence:
-Guard the best evidence closely.
-Don’t work off the best evidence.
-Keep the chain of custody up-to-date
-Don’t produce the hardware in the court as evidence unless asked for.
-Get rid of the evidence as soon as you can


The guidelines to be followed so that proper chain of custody for the digital forensic evidence
can be maintained are mentioned below:
• Ensure that the investigators have a strong knowledge and experience in IT and
telecommunications.
• Documentation of all sources of data from time of receipt of the evidence.
• Keep the original package materials in safe custody.
• Take pictures of physical evidence.
• Store the screenshots of digital evidence content.
• Use write-blocking devices to ensure no data change takes place even inadvertently.
• Make Bit-by-bit image copy of the evidence.
• Perform a hash test analysis to authenticate working clone.
• Ensure that the file hashes match up at all stages of investigation.
• Ensure that the documentation of all evidence artefacts and maintenance of case logs
for all the evidence related activities is performed in an orderly manner.
• Most of the digital forensic investigations today relies on automated software tools
and hence the tools used in the investigations have to be audited so that they are
reliable and function as intended.

Area of Cyber Law: 
Cyber laws contain different types of purposes. Some laws create rules for how individuals and companies may use computers and the internet while some laws protect people from becoming the victims of crime through unscrupulous activities on the internet. The major areas of cyber law include:  
-Fraud: Consumers depend on cyber laws to protect them from online fraud. Laws are made to prevent identity theft, credit card theft, and other financial crimes that happen online. A person who commits identity theft may face confederate or state criminal charges. They might also encounter a civil action brought by a victim. Cyber lawyers work to both defend and prosecute against allegations of fraud using the internet.  
-Copyright: The internet has made copyright violations easier. In the early days of online communication, copyright violations were too easy. Both companies and individuals need lawyers to bring an action to impose copyright protections. Copyright violation is an area of cyber law that protects the rights of individuals and companies to profit from their creative works.  
-Defamation: Several personnel uses the internet to speak their mind. When people use the internet to say things that are not true, it can cross the line into defamation. Defamation laws are civil laws that save individuals from fake public statements that can harm a business or someone’s reputation. When people use the internet to make statements that violate civil laws, that is called Defamation law.  
-Harassment and Stalking: Sometimes online statements can violate criminal laws that forbid harassment and stalking. When a person makes threatening statements again and again about someone else online, there is a violation of both civil and criminal laws. Cyber lawyers both prosecute and defend people when stalking occurs using the internet and other forms of electronic communication. 
-Freedom of Speech: Freedom of speech is an important area of cyber law. Even though cyber laws forbid certain behaviors online, freedom of speech laws also allows people to speak their minds. Cyber lawyers must advise their clients on the limits of free speech including laws that prohibit obscenity. Cyber lawyers may also defend their clients when there is a debate about whether their actions consist of permissible free speech.  
-Trade Secrets: Companies doing business online often depend on cyber laws to protect their trade secrets. For example, Google and other online search engines spend lots of time developing the algorithms that produce search results. They also spend a great deal of time developing other features like maps, intelligent assistance, and flight search services to name a few. Cyber laws help these companies to take legal action as necessary to protect their trade secrets. 
-Contracts and Employment Law: Every time you click a button that says you agree to the terms and conditions of using a website, you have used cyber law. There are terms and conditions for every website that are somehow related to privacy concerns. 

 
Advantages of Cyber Law: 
-Organizations are now able to carry out e-commerce using the legal infrastructure provided by the Act. 
-Digital signatures have been given legal validity and sanction in the Act. 
-It has opened the doors for the entry of corporate companies for issuing Digital Signatures Certificates in the business of being Certifying Authorities. 
-It allows Government to issue notifications on the web thus heralding e-governance.  
-It gives authority to the companies or organizations to file any form, application, or any other document with any office, authority, body, or agency owned or controlled by the suitable Government in e-form using such e-form as may be prescribed by the suitable Government.  
-The IT Act also addresses the important issues of security, which are so critical to the success of electronic transactions. 
-Cyber Law provides both hardware and software security.


Cyber law - SECTION & PUNISHMENT:

Electronic Signature: 
Electronic Signature is a digital form of a wet ink signature which is legally binding and secure but it does not incorporate any coding or standards. It can be a symbol, image, process attached to the message or document to recognize the identity and to give consent on it. When we need to only verify the document we use electronic signature. The validation of electronic signature is not performed by any trusted certificate authorities or trust service providers so it is not usually authorized. Electronic signature is very easy to use than digital signature but it is less secured and less authentic than digital signature. 
The different types of electronic signatures are:
a) Passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs) – This is based on the knowledge
of the user.
b) Biometric authentication - This method is based on the physical features or personal
trait of the user.
c) Scanned handwritten signatures.
d) Signature by means of a digital pen.
e) “OK” or “I accept” boxes.
f) Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates.

Digital Signature: Digital Signature is a secured signature which works with Electronic signature and rely on Public key infrastructure means it comes with encryption standards. It can be visualized as an electronic finger print which encrypts and identifies a person’s identity. When we need to secure a document we use digital signature. The validation of digital signature is performed by trusted certificate authorities or trust service providers so it is usually authorized. Digital signature is preferred over electronic signature as it is more secured and more authentic than the electronic signature.
