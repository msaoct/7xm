Single gene disorder/Mendelian disorder:
Mendelian disorders, also known as Mendelian genetic disorders or monogenic disorders, are a category of genetic diseases that result from mutations in a single gene. These disorders follow Mendelian inheritance patterns, which are predictable and often follow simple rules of inheritance.

There are three main types of Mendelian disorders:
1.Autosomal Dominant Disorders: In these disorders, a mutation in one copy of the gene (one allele) is sufficient to cause the disease. A child has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated gene from an affected parent. Examples include Huntington's disease and Marfan syndrome.
2.Autosomal Recessive Disorders: For these disorders, an individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. If both parents are carriers (heterozygous), there is a 25% chance their child will have the disorder. Examples include cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia.
3.X-Linked Disorders: These disorders are caused by mutations in genes located on the X chromosome. They primarily affect males because they have only one X chromosome. Females, with two X chromosomes, are usually carriers. Examples include hemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
Mendelian disorders can manifest with a wide range of symptoms and severity levels, depending on the specific gene and mutation involved. Advances in genetic testing and understanding of these disorders have led to better diagnosis, management, and, in some cases, potential treatments.
Genetic counseling and testing play crucial roles in helping individuals and families at risk of Mendelian disorders make informed decisions about family planning and healthcare. Additionally, ongoing genetic research continues to uncover new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these disorders, offering hope for improved therapies and interventions in the future.

Monomers:
The word monomer comes from mono- (one) and -mer (part). Monomers are small molecules which may be joined together in a repeating fashion to form more complex molecules called polymers. Monomers form polymers by forming chemical bonds or binding supramolecularly through a process called polymerization.
Sometimes polymers are made from bound groups of monomer subunits (up to a few dozen monomers) called oligomers. To qualify as an oligomer, the properties of the molecule need to change significantly if one or a few subunits are added or removed. Examples of oligomers include collagen and liquid paraffin.
A related term is "monomeric protein," which is a protein that bonds to make a multiprotein complex. Monomers are not just building blocks of polymers, but are important molecules in their own right, which do not necessarily form polymers unless the conditions are right.
Examples of Monomers:
Examples of monomers include vinyl chloride (which polymerizes into polyvinyl chloride or PVC), glucose (which polymerizes into starch, cellulose, laminarin, and glucans), and amino acids (which polymerize into peptides, polypeptides, and proteins). 

Polymers:
The word polymer comes from poly- (many) and -mer (part). A polymer may be a natural or synthetic macromolecule comprised of repeating units of a smaller molecule (monomers). While many people use the term 'polymer' and 'plastic' interchangeably, polymers are a much larger class of molecules which includes plastics, plus many other materials, such as cellulose, amber, and natural rubber.
The classes of biological molecules may be grouped into the types of polymers they form and the monomers that act as subunits:
Lipids - polymers called diglycerides, triglycerides; monomers are glycerol and fatty acids
Proteins - polymers are known as polypeptides; monomers are amino acids
Nucleic Acids - polymers are DNA and RNA; monomers are nucleotides, which are in turn consist of a nitrogenous base, pentose sugar, and phosphate group
Carbohydrates - polymers are polysaccharides and disaccharides*; monomers are monosaccharides (simple sugars)

Difference Between Starch And Cellulose:
Cellulose and starch are identical polymers that have the same repeat units dependent on glucose and are composed of the same glucose and monomer. There is one major difference between Starch and Cellulose. For starch, glucose repeat units are located in the same direction, and each successive glucose unit is rotated 180 degrees in cellulose.
Cellulose is thicker than sugar, which is water-insoluble. On the other hand, the Starch is less weak than cellulose and can be dissolved in warm water. Cellulose is not suitable for human consumption because mammals will eat starch. Many of the cellulose applications are in rayon substitute, cellophane, etc. Throughout the paper industry as well as in the manufacture of cloths such as linen and cotton, it is used commercially as the main ingredient.
1.Alpha/Beta Types:
Starch: Comprises two types of alpha glucose.
Cellulose: Consists of one type of beta glucose.
2.Connection Type:
Starch: Connected by alpha linkage.
Cellulose: Connected by beta linkage.
3.Digestibility:
Starch: Easily digested.
Cellulose: Difficult to digest.
4.Solubility:
Starch: Dissolves in warm water.
Cellulose: Does not dissolve in water.
5.Strength:
Starch: Weaker than cellulose.
Cellulose: Strong.
6.Crystalline Structure:
Starch: Less crystalline.
Cellulose: More crystalline than starch.
7.Consumption:
Starch: Consumable by humans.
Cellulose: Not consumable by humans.
8.Linkage Type:
Starch: Contains alpha 1,4 linkage.
Cellulose: Contains beta 1,4 linkage.
9.Uses in Plants:
Starch: Used by plants to store energy.
Cellulose: Used by plants to provide structural support.

Biomolecules:
All living organisms are made up of a fundamental unit called the cell. Each cell is made up of organic as well as inorganic compounds. The elemental analysis of the cell constituents shows that a cell comprises carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc. Proteins, Carbohydrates, Fats, and Nucleic acids are known as Biomolecules.
Biomolecules are defined as any organic molecule present in a living cell which includes carbohydrates, proteins, fats etc. Each biomolecule is essential for body functions and manufactured within the body. They can vary in nature, type, and structure where some may be straight chains, some may be cyclic rings or both. Also, they can vary in physical properties such as water solubility and melting points.

Types of Biomolecules:
Biomolecules are primarily classified into 4 types, namely:
1.Carbohydrates:
Carbohydrates are macronutrients and are one of the three main ways by which our body obtains its energy. They are called carbohydrates as they comprise carbon, hydrogen and oxygen at their chemical level. Carbohydrates are essential nutrients which include sugars, fibers and starches. They are found in grains, vegetables, fruits and in milk and other dairy products. They are the basic food groups which play an important role in a healthy life.
The food containing carbohydrates are converted into glucose or blood sugar during the process of digestion by the digestive system.
Our body utilizes this sugar as a source of energy for the cells, organs and tissues. The extra amount of energy or sugar is stored in our muscles and liver for further requirement. The term ‘carbohydrate’ is derived from a French term ‘hydrate de carbone‘ meaning ‘hydrate of carbon‘. The general formula of this class of organic compounds is Cn(H2O)n.
We often see bodybuilders and physical trainer drinking whey protein along with milk to build-up metabolism and strength.When it comes to our body, our hair and nails are mostly made of proteins. Basically, proteins are the fundamental building blocks of our body. They are large and complex macromolecules or bio-molecules which perform a major role in the functioning and regulating of our body cells, tissues and other organs in the human body. They are also used in providing strength to our body in producing hormones, enzymes, and other metabolic chemicals. They are also involved in functioning and regulating of our body cells, tissues and organs.
2.Proteins:
Proteins are composed of amino acids, arranged into different groups. These fundamental amino acids sequences are specific and its arrangements are controlled by the DNA. Since our body cannot synthesize these essential amino acids by its own, we should have plenty of protein foods in our everyday diet to keep our body metabolisms stable.
3.Nucleic Acids:
Nucleic acids refer to the genetic material found in the cell that carries all the hereditary information from parents to progeny. There are two types of nucleic acids namely, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). The main function of nucleic acid is the transfer of genetic information and synthesis of proteins by processes known as translation and transcription. The monomeric unit of nucleic acids is known as nucleotide and is composed of a nitrogenous base, pentose sugar, and phosphate. The nucleotides are linked by a 3’ and 5’ phosphodiester bond. The nitrogen base attached to the pentose sugar makes the nucleotide distinct. There are 4 major nitrogenous bases found in DNA: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. In RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil. The DNA structure is described as a double-helix or double-helical structure which is formed by hydrogen bonding between the bases of two antiparallel polynucleotide chains. Overall, the DNA structure looks similar to a twisted ladder.
4.Lipids:
These organic compounds are nonpolar molecules, which are soluble only in nonpolar solvents and insoluble in water because water is a polar molecule. In the human body, these molecules can be synthesized in the liver and are found in oil, butter, whole milk, cheese, fried foods and also in some red meats.
Properties of Lipids:
Lipids are a family of organic compounds, composed of fats and oils. These molecules yield high energy and are responsible for different functions within the human body. Listed below are some important characteristics of Lipids.
Lipids are oily or greasy nonpolar molecules, stored in the adipose tissue of the body.
Lipids are a heterogeneous group of compounds, mainly composed of hydrocarbon chains.
Lipids are energy-rich organic molecules, which provide energy for different life processes.
Lipids are a class of compounds characterised by their solubility in nonpolar solvents and insolubility in water.
Lipids are significant in biological systems as they form a mechanical barrier dividing a cell from the external environment known as the cell membrane.

Enzymology : 
Enzymes (/ˈɛnzaɪmz/) are proteins that act as biological catalysts by accelerating chemical reactions. The molecules upon which enzymes may act are called substrates, and the enzyme converts the substrates into different molecules known as products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzyme catalysis in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life.[1]: 8.1  Metabolic pathways depend upon enzymes to catalyze individual steps. The study of enzymes is called enzymology and the field of pseudoenzyme analysis recognizes that during evolution, some enzymes have lost the ability to carry out biological catalysis, which is often reflected in their amino acid sequences.
Like all catalysts, enzymes increase the reaction rate by lowering its activation energy. Some enzymes can make their conversion of substrate to product occur many millions of times faster. An extreme example is orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase, which allows a reaction that would otherwise take millions of years to occur in milliseconds.[5][6] Chemically, enzymes are like any catalyst and are not consumed in chemical reactions, nor do they alter the equilibrium of a reaction. Enzymes differ from most other catalysts by being much more specific. Enzyme activity can be affected by other molecules: inhibitors are molecules that decrease enzyme activity, and activators are molecules that increase activity. Many therapeutic drugs and poisons are enzyme inhibitors. An enzyme's activity decreases markedly outside its optimal temperature and pH, and many enzymes are (permanently) denatured when exposed to excessive heat, losing their structure and catalytic properties.
Some enzymes are used commercially, for example, in the synthesis of antibiotics. Some household products use enzymes to speed up chemical reactions: enzymes in biological washing powders break down protein, starch or fat stains on clothes.

Examples of Enzymes
Following are some of the examples of enzymes:
Beverages: Alcoholic beverages generated by fermentation vary a lot based on many factors. Based on the type of the plant’s product, which is to be used and the type of enzyme applied, the fermented product varies. For example, grapes, honey, hops, wheat, cassava roots, and potatoes depending upon the materials available. Beer, wines and other drinks are produced from plant fermentation.
Food Products: Bread can be considered as the finest example of fermentation in our everyday life. A small proportion of yeast and sugar is mixed with the batter for making bread. Then one can observe that the bread gets puffed up as a result of fermentation of the sugar by the enzyme action in yeast, which leads to the formation of carbon dioxide gas. This process gives the texture to the bread, which would be missing in the absence of the fermentation process.
Drug Action: Enzyme action can be inhibited or promoted by the use of drugs which tend to work around the active sites of enzymes.

Types of enzymes: 
1.Oxidoreductases: These catalyze oxidation and reduction reactions, e.g. pyruvate dehydrogenase, catalysing the oxidation of pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A.
2.Transferases: These catalyze transferring of the chemical group from one to another compound. An example is a transaminase, which transfers an amino group from one molecule to another.
3.Hydrolases: They catalyze the hydrolysis of a bond. For example, the enzyme pepsin hydrolyzes peptide bonds in proteins.
4.Lyases: These catalyze the breakage of bonds without catalysis, e.g. aldolase (an enzyme in glycolysis) catalyzes the splitting of fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate.
5.Isomerases: They catalyze the formation of an isomer of a compound. Example: phosphoglucomutase catalyzes the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate (phosphate group is transferred from one to another position in the same compound) in glycogenolysis (glycogen is converted to glucose for energy to be released quickly).
6.Ligases: Ligases catalyze the association of two molecules. For example, DNA ligase catalyzes the joining of two fragments of DNA by forming a phosphodiester bond.

There are three kinds of cofactors present in enzymes:
Prosthetic groups: These are cofactors tightly bound to an enzyme at all times. FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) is a prosthetic group present in many enzymes.
Coenzyme: A coenzyme binds to an enzyme only during catalysis. At all other times, it is detached from the enzyme. NAD is a common coenzyme.
Metal ions: For the catalysis of certain enzymes, a metal ion is required at the active site to form coordinate bonds. Zinc is a metal ion cofactor used by a number of enzymes.

Functions of Enzymes:
1.The enzymes perform a number of functions in our bodies. These include-
2.Enzymes help in signal transduction. The most common enzyme used in the process includes protein kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of proteins.
3.They break down large molecules into smaller substances that can be easily absorbed by the body.
4.They help in generating energy in the body. ATP synthase is the enzyme involved in the synthesis of energy.
5.Enzymes are responsible for the movement of ions across the plasma membrane.
6.Enzymes perform a number of biochemical reactions, including oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, etc. to eliminate the non-nutritive substances from the body.
7.They function to reorganize the internal structure of the cell to regulate cellular activities.

Action and Nature of Enzymes:
Once substrate (S) binds to this active site, they form a complex (intermediate-ES) which then produces the product (P) and the enzyme (E). The substrate which gets attached to the enzyme has a specific structure and that can only fit in a particular enzyme. Hence, by providing a surface for the substrate, an enzyme slows down the activation energy of the reaction. The intermediate state where the substrate binds to the enzyme is called the transition state. By breaking and making the bonds, the substrate binds to the enzyme (remains unchanged), which converts into the product and later splits into product and enzyme. The free enzymes then bind to other substrates and the catalytic cycle continues until the reaction completes.
The enzyme action basically happens in two steps:
Step1: Combining of enzyme and the reactant/substrate.
E+S → [ES]
Step 2: Disintegration of the complex molecule to give the product.
[ES]→E+P
Thus, the whole catalyst action of enzymes is summarized as:
E + S → [ES] → [EP] → E + P

Enzyme-Substrate Interactions:
Enzymes are biocatalysts, which are high molecular weight proteinous compounds. It enhances the reactions which occur in the body during various life processes. It helps the substrate by providing the surface for the reaction to occur. The enzyme comprises hollow spaces occupying groups such as -SH, -COOH, and others on the outer surface. The substrate which has an opposite charge of the enzyme fits into these spaces, just like a key fits into a lock. This substrate binding site is called the active site of an enzyme (E).
The favourable model of enzyme-substrate interaction is called the induced-fit model. This model states that the interaction between substrate and enzyme is weak, and these weak interactions induce conformational changes rapidly and strengthen binding and bring catalytic sites close enough to substrate bonds.
There are four possible major mechanisms of catalysis:
-Catalysis by Bond Strain: The induced structural rearrangements in this type of catalysis produce strained substrate bonds that attain transition state more easily. The new conformation forces substrate atoms and catalytic groups like aspartate into conformations that strain substrate bonds.
-Covalent Catalysis: The substrate is oriented to active place on the enzymes in such a manner that a covalent intermediate develops between the enzyme and the substrate, in catalysis that occurs by covalent mechanisms. The best example of this involves proteolysis by serine proteases that have both digestive enzymes and various enzymes of the blood clotting cascade. These proteases possess an active site serine whose R group hydroxyl generates a covalent bond with a carbonyl carbon of a peptide bond and results in the hydrolysis of the peptide bond.
-Catalysis Involving Acids and Bases: Other mechanisms add to the completion of catalytic events which are launched by strain mechanisms such as the usage of glutamate as a general acid catalyst.
-Catalysis by Orientation and Proximity: Enzyme-substrate interactions induce reactive groups into proximity with one another. Also, groups like aspartate are chemically reactive, and their proximity towards the substrate favours their involvement in catalysis.

The mechanism of enzyme action:
Enzymes are proteins that speed up chemical reactions in the body. The mechanism of enzyme action is as follows: 
1.The enzyme and the substrate are in the same area. Some situations have more than one substrate molecule that the enzyme will change.
2.The enzyme grabs on to the substrate at a special area called the active site. The combination is called the enzyme/substrate complex. Enzymes are very, very specific and don't just grab on to any molecule. The active site is a specially shaped area of the enzyme that fits around the substrate. The active site is like the grasping claw of the robot on the assembly line. It can only pick up one or two parts.
3.A process called catalysis happens. Catalysis is when the substrate is changed. It could be broken down or combined with another molecule to make something new. It will break or build chemical bonds. When done, you will have the enzyme/products complex.
4.The enzyme releases the product. When the enzyme lets go, it returns to its original shape. It is then ready to work on another molecule of substrate.
The combination of an enzyme and its substrates is called the enzyme–substrate complex.
Enzymes are biological catalysts. They reduce activation energy, allowing reactions to proceed in a desired direction. Enzymes are essential for digestion, liver function, and more. 

Mechanism of Enzyme Reaction:
Any two molecules have to collide for the reaction to occur along with the right orientation and a sufficient amount of energy. The energy between these molecule. needs to overcome the barrier in the reaction. This energy is called activation energ
Enzymes are said to possess an active site. The active site is a part of the molecule has a definite shape and the functional group for the binding of reactant molecules The molecule that binds to the enzyme is referred to as the substrate group. The substrate and the enzyme form an intermediate reaction with low activation energ without any catalysts.
- reactant (1) + reactant(2) → product 
- reactant(1) + enzyme → intermediate 
- intermediate + reactant (2) → product + enzyme
The basic mechanism of enzyme action is to catalyze the chemical reactions, which begins with the binding of the substrate with the active site of the enzyme. This active site is a specific area that combines with the substrate

Active site of an enzyme:
The enzyme’s active site is a cleft or a pocket within the enzyme where the substrate molecule binds and undergoes chemical reactions to be converted into the product.

Lock and key hypothesis of enzymes: 
Enzymes are very specific and it was suggested by Fischer in 1890 that this was because the enzyme had a particular shape into which the substrate or substrates fit exactly.This is often referred as Lock and Key hypothesis.
Lock and Key model:
-According to this model, shape of active site of enzyme is complementary to the shape of substrate molecules. Ie. the substrate is like a key whose shape is complementary to the enzyme which is supposed to be lock and they fit perfectly.
-Enzymes catalyze only those substrates which fit perfectly on the active site of that enzyme
-Most enzymes are far larger than the substrates molecules that act on and the active site is usually a very small portion of the enzyme, between 3 and 12 amino acids. The remaining amino acids which make the bulk of the enzyme, function to maintain the correct globular shape of the enzyme.
-Once the product is formed, they no longer fit into the active site and escape into surrounding medium.
-According to lock and key model, enzymes behave as rigid molecules. However, most enzymes are globular and are flexible with varying shape.

INDUCED FIT MODEL of Enzymes:
-In 1959, Koshland suggested a modification to the ‘Lock and Key’ hypothesis which is known as ‘Induced fit’ hypothesis.
-Working from evidence that suggested that some enzymes and their active site are more flexible. To this, he proposed that the active site can modify its shape as the substrate interact with the enzyme.
-The amino acids which make up the active site are moulded into precise shape which enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function most efficiently.
-For instance, a suitable analogy to describe Induced fit model would be that of a hand changing the shape of the glove as the individual put on the glove. Therefore in this case, glove is the active site of enzyme and the hand is substrate.
-However, in some cases, the substrate molecules changes slightly as it enters the active site before binding.
The substrate gets attached to the enzyme which has a specific structure that can only be fitted in a particular enzyme. In Induced fit, the active site is not exactly complementary to the substrate but changes shape in the presence of a specific substrate to become complementary and initiate the reaction. When a substrate molecule interacts with an enzyme, if its composition is specifically correct, the shape of the enzyme’s Active site will change so that the substrate fits into it and an Enzyme – Substrate complex can be formed. After the reaction, an Enzyme-Product Complex is formed. The enzyme slows down the activation energy of the reaction by providing a surface to the substrate. The intermediate state where the substrate binds with the enzyme is called the transition state. The enzyme and substrate form bonds and then breaks them, which results in a product and later they split into product and enzyme. The enzymes then bind to other substrates the cycle continues till the reaction is completed. When the substrate (S) binds to its active site with the enzyme (E), a complex (intermediate ES) is developed which produces the product (P) and the enzyme. 
The steps included in enzyme actions are:
Step 1: The enzyme and substrate combine and result in an intermediate substrate.
Step 2: The detachment of complex molecules gives the product and enzyme. 
The entire catalyst reaction of enzymes can be expressed as:
E  +  S  —>  (ES)  —>   E  +  P

Advantages of Induced Fit Model over Lock and Key Model
-This hypothesis provides the following two hypotheses:
-It illustrates the wide specificity of enzymes. For example, a variety of lipids can bind to lipase enzymes. for substrates.
-It outlines the possible causes of catalysis, i.e., the bonds in the substrate are stressed by the conformational change, boosting reactivity.

Proteins:
Proteins are known as the building blocks of life because they are the most abundant molecules present in the body and form about 60% of the dry weight of cells.
They make up the majority of the cells in all living things. Aside from cells, proteins make up the majority of the body’s structural, regulatory, and enzyme components. They are therefore crucial for an individual’s growth and development.
Food like eggs, pulses, milk and other milk products form the major high-protein foods for the body.

Classification of Proteins:
Based on the molecular shape, proteins can be classified into two types.
1. Fibrous Proteins:
When the polypeptide chains run parallel and are held together by hydrogen and disulfide bonds, then the fiber-like structure is formed. Such proteins are generally insoluble in water. These are water-insoluble proteins.
Example – keratin (present in hair, wool, and silk) and myosin (present in muscles), etc.
2. Globular Proteins:
This structure results when the chains of polypeptides coil around to give a spherical shape. These are usually soluble in water.
Example – Insulin and albumins are common examples of globular proteins.

Structure of protein:
Protein structure is defined as a polymer of amino acids joined by peptide bonds. Protein structures are made by condensation of amino acids forming peptide bonds. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is called its primary structure. The secondary structure is determined by the dihedral angles of the peptide bonds, the tertiary structure by the folding of protein chains in space. Association of folded polypeptide molecules to complex functional proteins results in quaternary structure.
A polymeric chain of amino acid residues constitutes proteins. A protein’s structure is primarily made up of long chains of amino acids. The arrangement and placement of amino acids give proteins certain characteristics. All amino acid molecules contain an amino (-NH2) and a carboxyl (-COOH) functional group. Hence, the name “Amino-Acid”.
Polypeptide chains are synthesized by linking together amino acids. A protein is created when one or more of these chains fold in a specific way. Methane is substituted by amino acids, with hydrogen, amino groups, carboxyl groups, and a variable R- group filling the first three valencies of the – alpha carbon.
There are many sorts of amino acids depending on the R-group, and a polypeptide chain contains 20 of them. The final structure and purpose of proteins are determined by all these characteristics of amino acids.
The structure of the protein is classified at 4 levels:-
1.Primary – The primary structure of a protein is the linear polypeptide chain formed by the amino acids in a particular sequence. Changing the position of even a single amino acid will result in a different chain and hence a different protein.
2.Secondary – The secondary structure of a protein is formed by hydrogen bonding in the polypeptide chain. These bonds cause the chain to fold and coil in two different conformations known as the α-helix or β-pleated sheets. The α-helix is like a single spiral and is formed by hydrogen bonding between every fourth amino acid. The β-pleated sheet is formed by hydrogen bonding between two or more adjacent polypeptide chains.
3.Tertiary – The tertiary structure is the final 3-dimensional shape acquired by the polypeptide chains under the attractive and repulsive forces of the different R-groups of each amino acid. This is a coiled structure that is very necessary for protein functions.
4.Quaternary – This structure is exhibited only by those proteins which have multiple polypeptide chains combined to form a large complex. The individual chains are then called subunits.

Rules of Protein Structure:
1.The type determines the function of a protein.
2.A protein’s shape is determined by its primary structure (the amino acid sequence).
3.The amino acid sequence within a protein is determined by the encoding sequence of nucleotides in the gene (DNA).

Functions of Proteins:
The body uses proteins for a variety of purposes, and their structure determines how they work. Several notable functions include:
-Digestion – The digestive enzymes, which are primarily proteinaceous in origin, carry out digestion.
-Movement – Muscles include a protein called myosin, which helps muscles contract, allowing for movement.
-Structure and Support – The structural protein known as keratin is what gives humans and other animals hair, nails, and horns.
-Cellular communication – Through receptors on their surface, cells can communicate with other cells and the outside world. These receptors are made of proteins.
-Act as a messenger – These proteins serve as chemical messengers that facilitate communication among cells, tissues, and organs.

Exothermic and endothermic versus endergonic and exergoinc reactions:
In biology, the concepts of exothermic and endothermic reactions are closely related to the terms endergonic and exergonic, but they have some nuanced differences in their application:
Exothermic Reaction (in Biology):
In biology, exothermic reactions typically refer to biochemical processes that release heat or energy.
For example, the process of cellular respiration involves the breakdown of glucose to release energy, and it's considered exothermic.
Endothermic Reaction (in Biology):
Endothermic reactions in biology are biochemical processes that absorb heat or energy from their surroundings.
For instance, photosynthesis is an endothermic process as it requires energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose.
Endergonic Reaction (in Biology):
Endergonic reactions in biology are those that require an input of energy to proceed. These reactions are not necessarily associated with heat exchange.
An example of an endergonic process in biology is the synthesis of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which requires energy to combine adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) to form ATP.
Exergonic Reaction (in Biology):
Exergonic reactions in biology release free energy and are often associated with processes that break down molecules to release energy.
Cellular respiration, which involves the breakdown of glucose to produce energy, is considered an exergonic process.
The key difference is that exothermic and endothermic reactions primarily refer to heat exchange in biological processes, while endergonic and exergonic reactions focus on the net energy changes, especially in terms of free energy (ΔG). Endergonic reactions require an input of energy, whereas exergonic reactions release energy, regardless of heat exchange.
(Gibbs free energy, also known as the Gibbs function, Gibbs energy, or free enthalpy, is a quantity that is used to measure the maximum amount of work done in a thermodynamic system when the temperature and pressure are kept constant. Gibbs free energy is denoted by the symbol 'G'.)

DNA:
Nucleic acids are the organic materials present in all organisms in the form of DNA or RNA. These nucleic acids are formed by the combination of nitrogenous bases, sugar molecules and phosphate groups that are linked by different bonds in a series of sequences. The DNA structure defines the basic genetic makeup of our body. In fact, it defines the genetic makeup of nearly all life on earth.
“DNA is a group of molecules that is responsible for carrying and transmitting the hereditary materials or the genetic instructions from parents to offsprings.”
This is also true for viruses, as most of these entities have either RNA or DNA as their genetic material. For instance, some viruses may have RNA as their genetic material, while others have DNA as the genetic material. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) contains RNA, which is then converted into DNA after attaching itself to the host cell.
Apart from being responsible for the inheritance of genetic information in all living beings, DNA also plays a crucial role in the production of proteins. Nuclear DNA is the DNA contained within the nucleus of every cell in a eukaryotic organism. It codes for the majority of the organism’s genomes while the mitochondrial DNA and plastid DNA handles the rest. The DNA present in the mitochondria of the cell is termed mitochondrial DNA. It is inherited from the mother to the child. In humans, there are approximately 16,000 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA. Similarly, plastids have their own DNA, and they play an essential role in photosynthesis.

Full-Form of DNA:
DNA is known as Deoxyribonucleic Acid. It is an organic compound that has a unique molecular structure. It is found in all prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells.

Discovery of DNA:
DNA was first recognized and identified by the Swiss biologist Johannes Friedrich Miescher in 1869 during his research on white blood cells. The double helix structure of a DNA molecule was later discovered through the experimental data by James Watson and Francis Crick. Finally, it was proved that DNA is responsible for storing genetic information in living organisms.

DNA Types
There are three different DNA types:
1.A-DNA: It is a right-handed double helix similar to the B-DNA form. Dehydrated DNA takes an A form that protects the DNA during extreme conditions such as desiccation. Protein binding also removes the solvent from DNA, and the DNA takes an A form.
2.B-DNA: This is the most common DNA conformation and is a right-handed helix. The majority of DNA has a B type conformation under normal physiological conditions.
3.Z-DNA: Z-DNA is a left-handed DNA where the double helix winds to the left in a zig-zag pattern. It was discovered by Andres Wang and Alexander Rich. It is found ahead of the start site of a gene and hence, is believed to play some role in gene regulation.

DNA Structure:
DNA comprises a sugar-phosphate backbone and the nucleotide bases (guanine, cytosine, adenine and thymine).
The DNA structure can be thought of as a twisted ladder. This structure is described as a double-helix, as illustrated in the figure above. It is a nucleic acid, and all nucleic acids are made up of nucleotides. The DNA molecule is composed of units called nucleotides, and each nucleotide is composed of three different components such as sugar, phosphate groups and nitrogen bases. 
The basic building blocks of DNA are nucleotides, which are composed of a sugar group, a phosphate group, and a nitrogen base. The sugar and phosphate groups link the nucleotides together to form each strand of DNA. Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G)  and Cytosine (C) are four types of nitrogen bases.
These 4 Nitrogenous bases pair together in the following way: A with T, and C with G. These base pairs are essential for the DNA’s double helix structure, which resembles a twisted ladder.
The order of the nitrogenous bases determines the genetic code or the DNA’s instructions.
Among the three components of DNA structure, sugar is the one which forms the backbone of the DNA molecule. It is also called deoxyribose. The nitrogenous bases of the opposite strands form hydrogen bonds, forming a ladder-like structure.
The DNA molecule consists of 4 nitrogen bases, namely adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) and Guanine (G), which ultimately form the structure of a nucleotide. The A and G are purines, and the C and T are pyrimidines.
The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions. These strands are held together by the hydrogen bond that is present between the two complementary bases. The strands are helically twisted, where each strand forms a right-handed coil, and ten nucleotides make up a single turn.
The pitch of each helix is 3.4 nm. Hence, the distance between two consecutive base pairs (i.e., hydrogen-bonded bases of the opposite strands) is 0.34 nm.
The DNA coils up, forming chromosomes, and each chromosome has a single molecule of DNA in it. Overall, human beings have around twenty-three pairs of chromosomes in the nucleus of cells. DNA also plays an essential role in the process of cell division.
The genetic material in most organisms is DNA or Deoxyribonucleic acid; whereas in some viruses, it is RNA or Ribonucleic acid. A DNA molecule consists of two polynucleotide chains i.e. chains with multiple nucleotides. Let’s understand the structure of this chain in detail.
Structure Of Polynucleotide Chain-
A nucleotide is made of the following components:
1.Pentose sugar – A pentose sugar is a 5-carbon sugar. In case of DNA, this sugar is deoxyribose whereas, in RNA, it is ribose.
2.Phosphate group.
3.Nitrogenous base – These can be of two types – Purines and Pyrimidines. Purines include Adenine and Guanine whereas pyrimidines include Cytosine and Thymine. In RNA, thymine is replaced by Uracil.
-Nitrogenous base + pentose sugar (via N-glycosidic linkage) = Nucleoside.
-Nucleoside + phosphate group (via phosphoester linkage) = Nucleotide.
-Nucleotide + Nucleotide (via 3′-5′ phosphodiester linkage) = Dinucleotide.
-Many nucleotides linked together = Polynucleotide.
A polynucleotide has a free phosphate group at the 5′ end of the sugar and this is called the 5′ end. Similarly, the sugar also has a free 3′-OH group at the other end of the polynucleotide which is called the 3′ end. The backbone of a polynucleotide chain consists of pentose sugars and phosphate groups; whereas the nitrogenous bases project out of this backbone.
Double Helix Structure-
DNA is a long polymer and therefore, difficult to isolate from cells in an intact form. This is why it is difficult to study its structure. However, in 1953, James Watson and Francis revealed the ‘double helix’ model of the structure of DNA, based on X-ray diffraction data from Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin.
This model also reveals a unique property of polynucleotide chains – Base pairing. It refers to the hydrogen bonds that connect the nitrogen bases on opposite DNA strands. This pairing gives rise to complementary strands i.e. if you know the sequence of bases on one strand, you can predict the bases on the other strand. Additionally, if each DNA strand acts as a template for synthesis (parent) of a new strand, then the new double-stranded DNA (daughters) produced are identical to the parental DNA strand.

Energy Currency of the Cell:
All living things including plants, animals, birds, insects, humans need energy for the proper functioning of cells, tissues and other organ systems. As we are aware that green plants, obtain their energy from the sunlight, and animals get their energy by feeding on these plants. Energy acts as a source of fuel. We, humans, gain energy from the food we eat, but how are the energy produced and stored in our body.
What is ATP-Adenosine Triphosphate?
ATP – Adenosine triphosphate is called the energy currency of the cell.
It is the organic compound composed of the phosphate groups, adenine, and the sugar ribose. These molecules provide energy for various biochemical processes in the body. Therefore, it is called “Energy Currency of the Cell”. These ATP molecules are synthesized by Mitochondria, therefore it is called powerhouse of the cell.
The ATP molecule was discovered in the year 1929 by German chemist Karl Lohmann. Later in the year 1948, Scottish biochemist Alexander Todd was the first person to synthesized the ATP molecule.
ATP – the energy-carrying molecules are found in the cells of all living things. These organic molecules function by capturing the chemical energy obtained from the digested food molecules and are later released for different cellular processes.

This is how Energy Produced by the ATP molecules:
The three phosphate groups present in this ATP molecule are called high energy bonds as they are involved in the liberation of a huge amount of energy when they are broken. This molecule provides energy for various life processes without which life cannot exist.
It is used by various enzymes and structural proteins in cellular processes like biosynthetic reactions, cell divisions, etc. This “energy currency of the cell” is produced during cellular respiration where a digested simple molecule of food is utilized.
Once after the energy is produced by the ATP molecules, they are stored in its bonds which are
later utilized by the cells by breaking the bonds whenever required

Functions of ATP:
The ATP is used for various cellular functions, including transportation of different molecules across cell membranes.
Other functions of ATP include supplying the energy required for the muscle contraction, circulation of blood, locomotion and various body movements.
A significant role of ATP apart from energy production includes: synthesizing the multi- thousand types of macromolecules that the cell requires for their survival. ATP molecule is also used as a switch to control chemical reactions and to send messages.

Glycolysis:
Glycolysis is the process in which glucose is broken down to produce energy. It produces two molecules of pyruvate, ATP, NADH and water. The process takes place in the cytoplasm of a cell and does not require oxygen. It occurs in both aerobic and anaerobic organisms.
Step 1: A phosphate group is added to glucose in the cell cytoplasm, by the action of enzyme hexokinase. In this, a phosphate group is transferred from ATP to glucose forming glucose,6-phosphate. 
Step 2: Glucose-6-phosphate is isomerised into fructose,6-phosphate by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase.
Step 3: The other ATP molecule transfers a phosphate group to fructose 6-phosphate and converts it into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate by the action of the enzyme phosphofructokinase.
Step 4: The enzyme aldolase converts fructose 1,6-bisphosphate into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which are isomers of each other.
Step 5: Triose-phosphate isomerase converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate into glyceraldehyde 3- phosphate which is the substrate in the successive step of glycolysis.
Step 6: This step undergoes two reactions:
-The enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase transfers 1 hydrogen molecule from glyceraldehyde phosphate to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to form NADH + H+.
-Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase adds a phosphate to the oxidised glyceraldehyde phosphate to form 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate.
Step 7: Phosphate is transferred from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to ADP to form ATP with the help of phosphoglycerokinase. Thus two molecules of phosphoglycerate and ATP are obtained at the end of this reaction.
Step 8: The phosphate of both the phosphoglycerate molecules is relocated from the third to the second carbon to yield two molecules of 2-phosphoglycerate by the enzyme phosphoglyceromutase.
Step 9: The enzyme enolase removes a water molecule from 2-phosphoglycerate to form phosphoenolpyruvate.
Step 10: A phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate is transferred to ADP to form pyruvate and ATP by the action of pyruvate kinase. Two molecules of pyruvate and ATP are obtained as the end products.

Krebs cycle/TCA cycle:
The Krebs cycle or TCA cycle (tricarboxylic acid cycle) or Citric acid cycle is a series of enzyme catalysed reactions occurring in the mitochondrial matrix, where acetyl-CoA is oxidised to form carbon dioxide and coenzymes are reduced, which generate ATP in the electron transport chain.

Krebs Cycle Steps:
It is an eight-step process. Krebs cycle or TCA cycle takes place in the matrix of mitochondria under aerobic condition.
Step 1: The first step is the condensation of acetyl CoA with 4-carbon compound oxaloacetate to form 6C citrate, coenzyme A is released. The reaction is catalysed by citrate synthase.
Step 2: Citrate is converted to its isomer, isocitrate. The enzyme aconitase catalyses this reaction.
Step 3: Isocitrate undergoes dehydrogenation and decarboxylation to form 5C 𝝰 -ketoglutarate. A molecular form of CO2 is released. Isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyses the reaction. It is an NAD+ dependent enzyme. NAD+ is converted to NADH.
Step 4: 𝝰 -ketoglutarate undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to form succinyl CoA, a 4C compound. The reaction is catalyzed by the 𝝰 -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase enzyme complex. One molecule of CO2 is released and NAD+ is converted to NADH.
Step 5: Succinyl CoA forms succinate. The enzyme succinyl CoA synthetase catalyses the reaction. This is coupled with substrate-level phosphorylation of GDP to get GTP. GTP transfers its phosphate to ADP forming ATP.
Step 6: Succinate is oxidised by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase to fumarate. In the process, FAD is converted to FADH2.
Step 7: Fumarate gets converted to malate by the addition of one H2O. The enzyme catalysing this reaction is fumarase.
Step 8: Malate is dehydrogenated to form oxaloacetate, which combines with another molecule of acetyl CoA and starts the new cycle. Hydrogens removed, get transferred to NAD+ forming NADH. Malate dehydrogenase catalyses the reaction.

Photosynthesis Process:
The actual process occurs during the day and two inter-related phases are involved in the process:
1. Light Dependent Reaction: This reaction requires sunlight to produce energy molecules (ATP & NADPH). Moreover, photosynthesis increases with more photons (light) and consequently, more energy molecules are produced.
2. Light Independent Reaction: Essentially, the light-independent reaction uses the energy molecules produced by the light-dependent reaction to produce even more energy molecules.

Process of Photosynthesis Step by Step:
- The sunlight is absorbed by the chlorophyll in the leaves of the plants. Carbon dioxide enters the plant through structures called the stomata, which are usually found on the underside of the leaves. Water is absorbed through the roots of the plant.
- The light-dependent reaction occurs during the day. At this stage, water is spilt into its elements – oxygen and hydrogen ions. Then, the ions go through a series of electron carriers, eventually leading to the accumulation of hydrogen ions. As electrons get transferred from one electron carrier to another, energy is released. In this case, ATP & NADPH are released.
- The light Independent reaction uses the energy produced during light depending on the reaction to transform carbon dioxide into glucose. The transformation from carbon dioxide to glucose requires a few reactions. The same molecule produces glucose during this process.
- The lower parts of the leaves have rather “spaced out” cells. This structure permits carbon dioxide to permeate into other parts of the leaves, thereby facilitating the release of oxygen.

Thermodynamics as Applied to Biological Systems:
Definition: Thermodynamics is the study of energy and its transformations. In biological systems, thermodynamics governs the energy changes associated with biochemical reactions and processes.
First Law of Thermodynamics: States that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. In biological systems, this law emphasizes the conservation of energy during metabolic processes.
Second Law of Thermodynamics: Describes the tendency of systems to move towards increased entropy or disorder. In biological systems, it underscores the directionality of metabolic pathways and the spontaneous nature of certain biochemical reactions.
Entropy and Free Energy: Entropy is a measure of the randomness or disorder in a system. Free energy, in the context of biological systems, represents the energy available to do work. Processes that increase entropy are favored, while those that decrease free energy require an input of energy.

Exothermic and Endothermic vs. Endergonic and Exergonic Reactions:
Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions:
Exothermic Reaction: Releases energy to the surroundings in the form of heat. Combustion is a classic example.
Endothermic Reaction: Absorbs energy from the surroundings, often resulting in a decrease in temperature. Photosynthesis is an example.
Endergonic and Exergonic Reactions:
Endergonic Reaction: Absorbs energy, and the products have higher potential energy than the reactants. These reactions require an input of energy.
Exergonic Reaction: Releases energy, and the products have lower potential energy than the reactants. These reactions release energy that can be used for cellular work.
Biological Examples:
Exothermic: Cellular respiration, where glucose is oxidized to produce energy.
Endothermic: Photosynthesis, where energy from sunlight is absorbed to synthesize glucose.
Cellular Implications:
Exergonic reactions provide energy for cellular work.
Endergonic reactions require energy input and often involve energy-storing processes such as ATP synthesis.
Role in Metabolism: Metabolic pathways involve both endergonic and exergonic reactions. Endergonic reactions often require energy input, provided by exergonic reactions, creating a balance in cellular energy transactions.
Coupling of Reactions: Biological systems often couple endergonic reactions (energy-consuming) with exergonic reactions (energy-releasing) to drive cellular processes. ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a key mediator in this energy coupling.

Spontaneity:
Spontaneous Reactions:
Spontaneous reactions occur without external intervention and tend to move towards equilibrium.
It does not imply the speed of the reaction; some spontaneous reactions may occur slowly.
Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) and Spontaneity:
For a reaction to be spontaneous, ΔG must be negative.
ΔG = ΔH - TΔS, where ΔH is the enthalpy change, T is temperature, and ΔS is the entropy change.
Negative ΔG and Equilibrium:
A negative ΔG indicates that the reaction releases free energy, and the system moves towards a more stable state.
At equilibrium, ΔG is zero, and the system is in a state of minimum free energy.
Biological Examples:
Cellular respiration is a spontaneous process, releasing energy for cellular activities.
Photosynthesis, though endergonic, becomes spontaneous when coupled with exergonic reactions in cellular respiration.

Concept of Keq and its Relation to Standard Free Energy:
Definition of Keq: Keq, or the equilibrium constant, is a ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants at equilibrium for a given chemical reaction. It provides insight into the position of equilibrium.
Standard Free Energy (ΔG°): Standard free energy change (ΔG°) is the change in free energy under standard conditions (1 M concentration, 1 atm pressure, 25°C). ΔG° is related to Keq by the equation ΔG° = -RT ln(Keq), where R is the gas constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin.
Relation to Spontaneity: If ΔG° is negative, the reaction is exergonic and spontaneous in the forward direction. If ΔG° is positive, the reaction is endergonic and requires an input of energy to proceed spontaneously.
Keq and Equilibrium: When Keq is much greater than 1, the reaction favors the formation of products at equilibrium. Conversely, when Keq is much less than 1, the reaction favors the formation of reactants at equilibrium.

ATP as an Energy Currency:
Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) Overview:
ATP is a nucleotide that serves as the primary energy currency in cells. It consists of an adenine base, a ribose sugar, and three phosphate groups.
Energy Storage in ATP: The high-energy phosphate bonds in ATP store energy. When these bonds are hydrolyzed, ATP is converted to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi), releasing energy.
Role in Cellular Work: ATP powers cellular processes such as mechanical work (muscle contraction), transport work (active transport of ions), and chemical work (biosynthesis) by providing energy through hydrolysis reactions.
Regeneration of ATP: Cells constantly regenerate ATP through processes like cellular respiration (oxidative phosphorylation), where energy derived from nutrients is used to reattach a phosphate group to ADP.

Breakdown of Glucose to CO2 + H2O and Synthesis of Glucose from CO2 and H2O:
Glycolysis and Krebs Cycle (Glucose Breakdown):
Glycolysis: Occurs in the cytoplasm and breaks down glucose into pyruvate, producing ATP and NADH.
Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle): Takes place in the mitochondria, oxidizing pyruvate to produce CO2, ATP, NADH, and FADH2.
Photosynthesis (Synthesis of Glucose):
Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts and involves two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).
Carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) are used to produce glucose, with the release of oxygen (O2) during the process.

Energy Yielding and Consuming Reactions:
Energy-Yielding Reactions: In glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, the breakdown of glucose releases energy, captured in the form of ATP and reduced coenzymes (NADH, FADH2).
Energy-Consuming Reactions: In photosynthesis, energy from sunlight is used to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, consuming energy in the process.
Central Role of ATP: ATP plays a central role in both processes. In glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, ATP is produced through substrate-level phosphorylation. In photosynthesis, ATP is generated through the phosphorylation of ADP using the energy from light.

Concept of Energy:
Definition of Energy: Energy is the capacity to do work or cause a change. In biological systems, energy is essential for the performance of cellular work, such as the synthesis of macromolecules, transport of substances, and mechanical activities.
Forms of Energy: Energy exists in various forms, including kinetic energy (associated with motion), potential energy (stored energy based on position or state), chemical energy (stored in molecular bonds), and thermal energy (associated with heat).
Energy Transfer in Biological Systems: Energy is transferred and transformed within biological systems through metabolic processes. Organisms obtain energy from nutrients and convert it into a usable form, usually ATP, to power cellular activities.
Law of Conservation of Energy: The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. In biological systems, this principle emphasizes the importance of energy conservation during metabolic reactions.
